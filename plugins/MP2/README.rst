`h_apply_mp2 <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/MP2/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L487>`_
  Calls H_apply on the HF determinant and selects all connected single and double
  excitations (of the same symmetry). Auto-generated by the ``generate_h_apply`` script.


`h_apply_mp2_diexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/MP2/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L1>`_
  Generate all double excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.


`h_apply_mp2_monoexc <http://github.com/LCPQ/quantum_package/tree/master/src/MP2/H_apply.irp.f_shell_9#L305>`_
  Generate all single excitations of key_in using the bit masks of holes and
  particles.
  Assume N_int is already provided.
