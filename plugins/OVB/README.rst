OVB
=======================
The present module proposes an orthogonal Valence Bond analysis 
of the wave function, that are the printing of the various Hamiltonian 
matrix elements on the basis of the level of ionicity of the components 
of the wave function. 

Assumptions : it supposes that you have some orthogonal local orbitals within 
the active space and that you performed a CI within the active orbitals. 
Such CI might be complete or not, no matter.
