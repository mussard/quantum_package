Dressed_Ref_Hamiltonian
=======================
The following modules proposes to build an effective Hamiltonian 
spanned on the reference determinants supposed to be the CAS ones. 
The effective matrix Hamiltonian are built using the multi parentage 
proposal used in the MR-CCSD formalism of Giner et. al.  (JCP, 144, 064101 (2016); doi: 10.1063/1.4940781)
